# Quick Start Guide

## Test Mode (Creates output.txt file)

Run this to test without sending email:

```bash
python3 scrapper.py -test
```

This will:
- ✓ Fetch news from Malaysian newspapers
- ✓ Save results to `output.txt`
- ✓ Show you what would be sent
- ✗ NOT send any email

Check the results in `output.txt`

---

## Production Mode (Sends Real Email)

### Step 1: Set Your Gmail Credentials

**Option A: Use Config File (Recommended - Easier to maintain)**

Edit `config_credentials.txt` and add your Gmail details:

```txt
EMAIL_SENDER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
```

**Option B: Use Environment Variables**

```bash
export EMAIL_SENDER="your-email@gmail.com"
export EMAIL_PASSWORD="your-gmail-app-password"
```

**Important:** Use Gmail App Password, not your regular password!
- Get it here: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
- You need 2FA enabled first

### Step 2: Verify Email Recipients

Check that `config_emails.txt` has the correct email addresses:

```bash
cat config_emails.txt
```

Should show:
```
azlan@net1io.com
# Add more emails if needed
```

### Step 3: Run for Real

```bash
python3 scrapper.py
```

This will:
- ✓ Fetch latest WTE news
- ✓ Send email to azlan@net1io.com
- ✓ Show success/failure message

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed" error
- Make sure you're using Gmail **App Password**, not regular password
- Verify 2FA is enabled on your Google account

### "No email recipients configured"
- Check `config_emails.txt` has valid emails (no # at start of line)

### No articles found
- This is normal if there's no recent WTE news
- The email won't be sent if no articles found
